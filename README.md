Here's my first version of my "Mercury Live Coding Recap." It comes in two versions, one of which allows you to edit the document if you wish. It remains open to all possible improvements or additions in the future.
I hope this modest contribution of mine to this excellent live coding program, Mercury, will be enjoyable and helpful, and congratulations, of course, to its creator, Timo Hoogland!
