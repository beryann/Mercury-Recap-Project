Here's my first version of my "Mercury Live Coding Recap." 
It's a simple compilation of the tutorials on line in the browser. 
It will give you a general overview of how Mercury works. 
Caution! Tutorials on MIDI are not included.
I hope this modest contribution of mine to this excellent live coding program, Mercury, will be enjoyable and helpful, and congratulations, of course, to its creator, Timo Hoogland!
